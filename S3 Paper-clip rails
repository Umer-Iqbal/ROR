when we create duplicate of a product then it image will not duplicate using (gem 'deep_cloneable')
here is the method how we can duplicate the product using above gem
we will call the duplicate instance method in a job

class Product < ApplicationRecord
  has_attached_file :image, preserve_files: true, styles: { thumb: '500x500>' },
                    default_url: :default_workof_image_path

  def duplicate
    kopy = deep_clone
  end
end

above method will not duplicate the attachments we need to do this manually like below

  def duplicate
    kopy = deep_clone

    # Copy the attachment
    kopy.image = image

    kopy
  end

in this method we first create the shallow copy of the product and then assign the image of current object (product)
to the shallow copy object and then return it where it will save in this way we can also create copy of attachements too

if there are othere attachement we also need to assign them manually to
