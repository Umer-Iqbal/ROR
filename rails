query parameter:

  the page where we are going to pass:
    <%= link_to "lll", new_article_path(:name=> "umer") %>
  in controller we can access name like 
      def new
        debugger
        name = params[:name]
      end
      
      here if we check params then 
        params[:name] will print umer
        
        
session:

  the page where we are going to pass:
    <%= link_to "lll", new_article_path(:name=> "umer") %>
  in controller we can access name like 
      def new
        session[:session_value] = params[:name]
        debugger
      end
      
      now we can access it any in the whole application
        article > new
          <h1>
            <%= session[:session_value] %>
          </h1>
          
          

url parameter with complete cycle:
send id or parameteres using URL:

  in view url bar:
    http://localhost:3000/articles/active/ll
    
    in this case active will store in :var_status variable in the routes like in the given blow line

  in routes:
    get "/articles/:var_status/ll", to: "articles#index", foo: "jj"
    
    in this case :var_status will hold (active) that is passed using the "url" at above line-35 and "foo" is also a variable
    and in this case it always hold (jj) when a reques will come on this link 
    
  in controller:
    we can access the params send in url like
    
    def index
      @status = params["var_status"]  it will give the value (active) that is comming from url
      params["foo"]         it will give the value (jj) that is from the routes [we can use it here or make it instance varable to use
                            it in view like above line]      
    end
    
 in view:
  we can access the status comming form url using the instance variable like
  
    @status   it will give the value (active) that is comming form url line-35
  
  we can also send this value to partial as given blow
    
    <%= render partial: "product", locals: { status_value: @status } %>       now @status will store in the status_value and we can access
                                                                              it in partial using the status_value like blow    link< https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_view_overview.html#partial-layouts > 
                                                                              
  in partial:
    in partial _product.html.erb
      
      status_value          will hold (active) that is set in the above line-61 and we can use it here according to our need
      
      
      
      
send id or params using link_to or without using url:

  in view:
    <%= link_to "index_article", articles_path(:name=> "umer") %>                     this will go to articles controller and method index
    <%= link_to "index_article_using named params", articles_path(name: "umer") %>    this line also behave like above but here we are sending  
                                                                                      params using name parameters
    
  in controller:
    def index:
      @name_value = params["name"]              it will give the value (umer) that is passed form the view above remaining process will be
                                                be same as in [send id or parameteres using URL]
